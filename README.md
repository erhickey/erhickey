### About Me

I'm a software developer with over 15 years of professional experience working with numerous languages and technologies to build products and tools for the military, property insurance, health insurance, and healthcare industries. I've worked at organizations of all sizes and stages, but I'm happiest in a fast-paced environment with other motivated people.

I became a developer because I enjoy utilizing technology to solve practical problems, and because I love the continuous learning process encouraged by the software industry. I enjoy iterating and improving on my development skills and the software I write. Thus, I spend my free time learning about best practices, interesting technologies, and working on tools/configuration to improve my workflow.
